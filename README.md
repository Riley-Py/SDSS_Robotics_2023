# 29295C Program + Integration with EZ-Template
Again, there was a swtich, from making it ourselves to deciding on using a template that we found called "EZ-Template" with PROS 4 support.

# Why would we all of a sudden switch
- Time - we need the time to do the autonomous routines, and EZ-Template provides tools that makes that process more time-efficient and therefore, our autonomous routines better
- Resources - EZ-Template provides many resources that we wouldn't have been able to create ourselves that would be very useful for our robot
- Uses - Lemlib, another library for PROS, needs tracking wheels to perform what is known as odometry (odem).  Our robot is not designed around odem, and as a result, EZ-Template is the way to go
- PROS 4 - Compared to Lemlib, this version of EZ-Template has support for PROS 4, where the main feature is creating interactive, beautiful UIs on the brain using LVGL

  Hopefully this is the last major change within the project structure and we can finally get a start on some autonomous routines!
