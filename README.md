# Skills-Auton
Put any sort of skills autonomous routines in here as this is the dedicated branch to it. Make a zip and commit it to here manually.

If we have time, we will do this properly and have the actual files in here.  Since this is such short-notice, though, I figured that making zip files is a reliable way to recieve and send code quickly.
