# SDSS Robotics 29295C Codefor the 2023-2024 School year
PROS-4 version of the code that we made in PROS-3.  

# Why Did We Change to PROS 4?
- Updated code base to get the latest and greatest
- Added latest LVGL support that will immensely help with making the UI for the multiple selectors (i.e. Skills, autonomous routes, etc.)
- It's fun to try out something new

As well, when we do the diagram for the skills/autonomous routes, it will be in this branch and speaking of which, this branch will become the default branch henceforth.
